      <h1>Motivation</h1>

      <p>
        <em
          >The Chester Square Neighborhood Association is set on providing its residents with the 
        best living enviroment and community possible. Located on Massachusetts Avenue, the community 
        and its park are split by one of the busiest roadways in Boston. The park is a gorgeous greenspace
        for the paeople of Boston, primarily those in the greater Chester Square area. Luckily for residents,
        there are 4 major busses which trek through the area: silver lines 4 and 5 and bus route 1 and 43. 
        It goes without saying that many Bostonians have come to expect delays taking the MBTA. With this 
        in mind and new capital projects in the cities pipeline, such as the Boston Rapid Transit (BRT), we aim to examine the 
        reliability of the 4 busses which allow the citizens of Boston to venture to this park.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Our team anticipates to see that the busses running through this park (Silver Line 4,
          Silver Line 5, Route 1, and Route 43) expereiences many delays, especially during rush hour. We
        hope to be wrong in this assumption, but if it is true, we expect to have a good justification
        for the Boston Rapid Transit (BRT). </em

      <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
      <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

      <p>
        <em
          >All of our data is from the V3 API provided by the MBTA. We utilized 4 main datasets: Predictons,
		  Schedules, Trips, and Stops, all of which come as JSONS. Depending on the visualization and its needs,
		  we decided to convert any necessary date to CSV files for ease. This also made the data manipulation
		  process much easier as we could do much of it in Excel. Converting to a CSV file was made easy by the 
          multitude of online JSON/CSV converter tools. Each of the sheets has an ID associated for each instance. Each 
		  schedule is unique to each route. The schedule has a list of each stop along the way as well as its arrival/departure
		  time. Each trip follows a schedule and has the actual arrival/departure times. Finally, the preditoons follow each trip 
		  with its own list of arrival and departure times per stop.</em
        >
      </p>

      <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

      <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Overall, we aimed to address three major tasks through our project. 
          First, worked to provide a way for Chester Square Neighborhood residents and 
          other Bostonians alike to gain a sense of the busses which could be taken too and from
          the park. This includes, but  is not limited to, finding bus stops near them, finding
          the lines near them, and undertanding what times of day expereicne the most delays. 
          Second, we wanted to analyze the delays of busses over an extended period
          of time in order for commuters to gain a better understanding of the trends in interuptions
          in their travel. Third, our team strived to show the difference between the
          scheduled location and the physical locations of the busses through the various visualizations. <em
    
        >
      </p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>

      <p>
        <em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >In the beginning, we wanted to visualize three maps: one for the actual location of busses, one for the
		  shedueled location of busses, and one for the predicted location of busses. This became an issue for viewers since
		  they would have to track where each bus is along its ride and really did not provide a lot of analysis into the true
		  subject matter of our project; how do the different bus routes perform in terms of reliabilty? Also, we ran into an issue
		  with the data. We wanted to use logged data on a weekly basis, however, the data for MBTA predicitons frefreshes daily and reutilizes
		  IDs. Because of this, we went for a more static dataset. We also considered including all of the bars within the same bar chart, but because of 
		  possible occlusion, we decided to opt for multiple bar charts. </em
        >
      </p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p>
        <em
          >We were able to visualize the data for the MBTA busses which residents traveling to and from the Chester Square Parl area 
		  interact with. The biggest bit of information that we were able to find was that the busses do, in fact, seem to be onlyl partially reliable. 
		  Of course, there are issues that arrive everyday with transit, but regardless, there could be a case for increased development in this area. Because
		  of this, we do see a real case for the BRT as it may increase reliability in travel, especcially for those coming from a far location. We faced
		  many difficulties in this project including a complex API and a new library (D3), but we were able to combine our wide variety of skills to ultimately
		  create an interactive project.<em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          > We would love to expand this project to all of the MBTA eventually as we feel the discussion about the discrepencies between 
		  the scheduled, predicted, and actual arrival/departure times is one which all riders, regardless of route, could benefit from. We ultimately
		  would like to build a tool for a wider audience so that all areas fo the city could have a use case for confronting the city of Boston with 
		  their own transit-related issues. </em
